    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_E._Vaughan">Bill Vaughan</a> once said that "A citizen of America will cross the ocean to fight for democracy, but won't cross the street to vote". I made this app hoping to make voting fun and it doesn't cost $1.05

      This site values users' privacy. Polls created and votes casted are confidential. No one using this site knows who created which poll or who voted which way. If you flag a poll for abuse, that flag will be anonymous. But nothing is keeping you from commenting about it.

      You must be <%= link_to 'logged in', help_path(anchor: 'signup-login') %> and your account must be <%= link_to 'activated', help_path(anchor: 'activation') %> in order to create polls and vote. Your vote matters that's why we should make sure you are you and you are not a Google Spider.

    <li class="list-group-item">Once a poll is created, it cannot be modified. You can delete the polls you created at any time.</li>
